# Description
This web application was created in order to provide users with the convenience of ordering their meats from a 'click of a button' and also being able to instantly access invoices. Additionally, the users have the ability to keep track of previous invoices on the users profile page. The problem solved by this application is that it transforms the ordering process, from the users previously having to get in direct contact with the wholesaler to order their meats and retrieve there invoices, to now they can hop on the website to order meat and keep track of invoices.
